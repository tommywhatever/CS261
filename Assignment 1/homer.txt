sing goddess the wrath of achilles peleus son the ruinous wrath that
brought on the achaians woes innumerable and hurled down into hades
many strong souls of heroes and gave their bodies to be a prey to dogs
and all winged fowls and so the counsel of zeus wrought out its
accomplishment from the day when first strife parted atreides king of
men and noble achilles

who among the gods set the twain at strife and variance apollo the son
of leto and of zeus for he in anger at the king sent a sore plague upon
the host so that the folk began to perish because atreides had done
dishonour to chryses the priest for the priest had come to the
achaians fleet ships to win his daughters freedom and brought a
ransom beyond telling and bare in his hands the fillet of apollo the
fardarter upon a golden staff and made his prayer unto all the
achaians and most of all to the two sons of atreus orderers of the
host ye sons of atreus and all ye wellgreaved achaians now may the
gods that dwell in the mansions of olympus grant you to lay waste the
city of priam and to fare happily homeward only set ye my dear child
free and accept the ransom in reverence to the son of zeus fardarting
apollo

then all the other achaians cried assent to reverence the priest and
accept his goodly ransom yet the thing pleased not the heart of
agamemnon son of atreus but he roughly sent him away and laid stern
charge upon him saying let me not find thee old man amid the hollow
ships whether tarrying now or returning again hereafter lest the staff
and fillet of the god avail thee naught and her will i not set free
nay ere that shall old age come on her in our house in argos far from
her native land where she shall ply the loom and serve my couch but
depart provoke me not that thou mayest the rather go in peace

so said he and the old man was afraid and obeyed his word and fared
silently along the shore of the loudsounding sea then went that aged
man apart and prayed aloud to king apollo whom leto of the fair locks
bare hear me god of the silver bow that standest over chryse and
holy killa and rulest tenedos with might o smintheus if ever i built
a temple gracious in thine eyes or if ever i burnt to thee fat flesh of
thighs of bulls or goats fulfil thou this my desire let the danaans
pay by thine arrows for my tears

so spake he in prayer and phoebus apollo heard him and came down from
the peaks of olympus wroth at heart bearing on his shoulders his bow
and covered quiver and the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath
as the god moved and he descended like to night then he sate him aloof
from the ships and let an arrow fly and there was heard a dread
clanging of the silver bow first did the assail the mules and fleet
dogs but afterward aiming at the men his piercing dart he smote and
the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude

now for nine days ranged the gods shafts through the host but on the
tenth achilles summoned the folk to assembly for in his mind did
goddess hera of white arms put the thought because she had pity on the
danaans when she beheld them perishing now when they had gathered and
were met in assembly then achilles fleet of foot stood up and spake
among them son of atreus now deem i that we shall return wandering
home againif verily we might escape deathif war at once and
pestilence must indeed ravage the achaians but come let us now inquire
of some soothsayer or priest yea or an interpreter of dreamsseeing
that a dream too is of zeuswho shall say wherefore phoebus apollo is
so wroth whether he blame us by reason of vow or hecatomb if perchance
he would accept the savour of lambs or unblemished goats and so would
take away the pestilence from us

so spake he and sate him down and there stood up before them kalchas
son of thestor most excellent far of augurs who knew both things that
were and that should be and that had been before and guided the ships
of the achaians to ilios by his soothsaying that phoebus apollo bestowed
on him he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them achilles
dear to zeus thou biddest me tell the wrath of apollo the king that
smiteth afar therefore will i speak but do thou make covenant with me
and swear that verily with all thy heart thou wilt aid me both by word
and deed for of a truth i deem that i shall provoke one that ruleth all
the argives with might and whom the achaians obey for a king is more
of might when he is wroth with a meaner man even though for the one day
he swallow his anger yet doth he still keep his displeasure thereafter
in his breast till he accomplish it consider thou then if thou wilt
hold me safe

and achilles fleet of foot made answer and spake to him yea be of
good courage speak whatever soothsaying thou knowest for by apollo
dear to zeus him by whose worship thou o kalchas declarest thy
soothsaying to the danaans not even if thou mean agamemnon that now
avoweth him to be greatest far of the achaians

then was the noble seer of good courage and spake neither by reason
of a vow is he displeased nor for any hecatomb but for his priests
sake to whom agamemnon did despite and set not his daughter free and
accepted not the ransom therefore hath the fardarter brought woes upon
us yea and will bring nor will he ever remove the loathly pestilence
from the danaans till we have given the brighteyed damsel to her
father unbought unransomed and carried a holy hecatomb to chryse
then might we propitiate him to our prayer

so said he and sate him down and there stood up before them the hero
son of atreus wideruling agamemnon sore displeased and his dark
heart within him was greatly filled with anger and his eyes were like
flashing fire to kalchas first spake he with look of ill thou seer of
evil never yet hast thou told me the thing that is pleasant evil is
ever the joy of thy heart to prophesy but never yet didst thou tell any
good matter nor bring to pass and now with soothsaying thou makest
harangue among the danaans how that the fardarter bringeth woes upon
them because forsooth i would not take the goodly ransom of the damsel
chryseis seeing i am the rather fain to keep her own self within mine
house yea i prefer her before klytaimnestra my wedded wife in no wise
is she lacking beside her neither in favour nor stature nor wit nor
skill yet for all this will i give her back if that is better rather
would i see my folk whole than perishing only make ye me ready a prize
of honour forthwith lest i alone of all the argives be disprized which
thing beseemeth not for ye all behold how my prize is departing from
me
