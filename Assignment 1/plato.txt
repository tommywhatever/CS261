how you o athenians have been affected by my accusers i cannot tell
but i know that they almost made me forget who i wasso persuasively
did they speak and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth but
of the many falsehoods told by them there was one which quite amazed
mei mean when they said that you should be upon your guard and not
allow yourselves to be deceived by the force of my eloquence to say
this when they were certain to be detected as soon as i opened my lips
and proved myself to be anything but a great speaker did indeed appear
to me most shamelessunless by the force of eloquence they mean
the force of truth for is such is their meaning i admit that i am
eloquent but in how different a way from theirs well as i was saying
they have scarcely spoken the truth at all but from me you shall hear
the whole truth not however delivered after their manner in a set
oration duly ornamented with words and phrases no by heaven but i
shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment for
i am confident in the justice of my cause or i am certain that i am
right in taking this course at my time of life i ought not to be
appearing before you o men of athens in the character of a juvenile
oratorlet no one expect it of me and i must beg of you to grant me
a favourif i defend myself in my accustomed manner and you hear me
using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora at
the tables of the moneychangers or anywhere else i would ask you not
to be surprised and not to interrupt me on this account for i am more
than seventy years of age and appearing now for the first time in a
court of law i am quite a stranger to the language of the place and
therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger
whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the
fashion of his countryam i making an unfair request of you never
mind the manner which may or may not be good but think only of the
truth of my words and give heed to that let the speaker speak truly
and the judge decide justly

and first i have to reply to the older charges and to my first
accusers and then i will go on to the later ones for of old i have had
many accusers who have accused me falsely to you during many years
and i am more afraid of them than of anytus and his associates who are
dangerous too in their own way but far more dangerous are the others
who began when you were children and took possession of your minds with
their falsehoods telling of one socrates a wise man who speculated
about the heaven above and searched into the earth beneath and made
the worse appear the better cause the disseminators of this tale are
the accusers whom i dread for their hearers are apt to fancy that such
enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods and they are
many and their charges against me are of ancient date and they were
made by them in the days when you were more impressible than you are
nowin childhood or it may have been in youthand the cause when
heard went by default for there was none to answer and hardest of all
i do not know and cannot tell the names of my accusers unless in the
chance case of a comic poet all who from envy and malice have persuaded
yousome of them having first convinced themselvesall this class of
men are most difficult to deal with for i cannot have them up here and
crossexamine them and therefore i must simply fight with shadows in my
own defence and argue when there is no one who answers i will ask you
then to assume with me as i was saying that my opponents are of two
kinds one recent the other ancient and i hope that you will see the
propriety of my answering the latter first for these accusations you
heard long before the others and much oftener

well then i must make my defence and endeavour to clear away in a
short time a slander which has lasted a long time may i succeed if to
succeed be for my good and yours or likely to avail me in my cause
the task is not an easy one i quite understand the nature of it and so
leaving the event with god in obedience to the law i will now make my
defence

i will begin at the beginning and ask what is the accusation which has
given rise to the slander of me and in fact has encouraged meletus to
proof this charge against me well what do the slanderers say they
shall be my prosecutors and i will sum up their words in an affidavit
socrates is an evildoer and a curious person who searches into
things under the earth and in heaven and he makes the worse appear the
better cause and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others such is
the nature of the accusation it is just what you have yourselves seen
in the comedy of aristophanes aristoph clouds who has introduced a
man whom he calls socrates going about and saying that he walks in
air and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which i do
not pretend to know either much or littlenot that i mean to speak
disparagingly of any one who is a student of natural philosophy i
should be very sorry if meletus could bring so grave a charge against
me but the simple truth is o athenians that i have nothing to do with
physical speculations very many of those here present are witnesses to
the truth of this and to them i appeal speak then you who have heard
me and tell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold
forth in few words or in many upon such mattersyou hear their answer
and from what they say of this part of the charge you will be able to
judge of the truth of the rest

as little foundation is there for the report that i am a teacher and
take money this accusation has no more truth in it than the other
although if a man were really able to instruct mankind to receive
money for giving instruction would in my opinion be an honour to him
there is gorgias of leontium and prodicus of ceos and hippias of elis
who go the round of the cities and are able to persuade the young men
to leave their own citizens by whom they might be taught for nothing
and come to them whom they not only pay but are thankful if they may be
allowed to pay them there is at this time a parian philosopher residing
in athens of whom i have heard and i came to hear of him in this
wayi came across a man who has spent a world of money on the
sophists callias the son of hipponicus and knowing that he had sons
i asked him callias i said if your two sons were foals or calves
there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them we
should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably who would improve
and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence but as they
are human beings whom are you thinking of placing over them is there
any one who understands human and political virtue you must have
thought about the matter for you have sons is there any one there
is he said who is he said i and of what country and what does
he charge evenus the parian he replied he is the man and his
charge is five minae happy is evenus i said to myself if he really
has this wisdom and teaches at such a moderate charge had i the same
i should have been very proud and conceited but the truth is that i
have no knowledge of the kind

i dare say athenians that some one among you will reply yes
socrates but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought
against you there must have been something strange which you have been
doing all these rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen
if you had been like other men tell us then what is the cause of
them for we should be sorry to judge hastily of you now i regard this
as a fair challenge and i will endeavour to explain to you the reason
why i am called wise and have such an evil fame please to attend then
and although some of you may think that i am joking i declare that i
will tell you the entire truth men of athens this reputation of mine
has come of a certain sort of wisdom which i possess if you ask me what
kind of wisdom i reply wisdom such as may perhaps be attained by man
for to that extent i am inclined to believe that i am wise whereas the
persons of whom i was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which i may fail
to describe because i have it not myself and he who says that i have
speaks falsely and is taking away my character and here o men of
athens i must beg you not to interrupt me even if i seem to say
something extravagant for the word which i will speak is not mine i
will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit that witness shall
be the god of delphihe will tell you about my wisdom if i have any
and of what sort it is you must have known chaerephon he was early a
friend of mine and also a friend of yours for he shared in the recent
exile of the people and returned with you well chaerephon as you
know was very impetuous in all his doings and he went to delphi and
boldly asked the oracle to tell him whetheras i was saying i must beg
you not to interrupthe asked the oracle to tell him whether anyone was
wiser than i was and the pythian prophetess answered that there was no
man wiser chaerephon is dead himself but his brother who is in court
will confirm the truth of what i am saying
