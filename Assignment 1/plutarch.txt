theseus displaying not only great strength of body but equal bravery
and a quickness alike and force of understanding his mother aethra
conducting him to the stone and informing him who was his true father
commanded him to take from thence the tokens that aegeus had left and
to sail to athens  he without any difficulty set himself to the stone
and lifted it up but refused to take his journey by sea though it was
much the safer way and though his mother and grandfather begged him to
do so  for it was at that time very dangerous to go by land on the road
to athens no part of it being free from robbers and murderers  that
age produced a sort of men in force of hand and swiftness of foot and
strength of body excelling the ordinary rate and wholly incapable of
fatigue making use however of these gifts of nature to no good or
profitable purpose for mankind but rejoicing and priding themselves in
insolence and taking the benefit of their superior strength in the
exercise of inhumanity and cruelty and in seizing forcing and
committing all manner of outrages upon every thing that fell into their
hands all respect for others all justice they thought all equity and
humanity though naturally lauded by common people either out of want
of courage to commit injuries or fear to receive them yet no way
concerned those who were strong enough to win for themselves  some of
these hercules destroyed and cut off in his passage through these
countries but some escaping his notice while he was passing by fled
and hid themselves or else were spared by him in contempt of their
abject submission and after that hercules fell into misfortune and
having slain iphitus retired to lydia and for a long time was there
slave to omphale a punishment which he had imposed upon himself for the
murder then indeed lydia enjoyed high peace and security but in
greece and the countries about it the like villanies again revived and
broke out there being none to repress or chastise them  it was
therefore a very hazardous journey to travel by land from athens to
peloponnesus and pittheus giving him an exact account of each of these
robbers and villains their strength and the cruelty they used to all
strangers tried to persuade theseus to go by sea  but he it seems
had long since been secretly fired by the glory of hercules held him in
the highest estimation and was never more satisfied than in listening
to any that gave an account of him especially those that had seen him
or had been present at any action or saying of his  so that he was
altogether in the same state of feeling as in after ages themistocles
was when he said that he could not sleep for the trophy of miltiades
entertaining such admiration for the virtue of hercules that in the
night his dreams were all of that heros actions  and in the day a
continual emulation stirred him up to perform the like  besides they
were related being born of cousinsgerman  for aethra was daughter of
pittheus and alcmena of lysidice and lysidice and pittheus were brother
and sister children of hippodamia and pelops  he thought it therefore a
dishonorable thing and not to be endured that hercules should go out
everywhere and purge both land and sea from wicked men and he himself
should fly from the like adventures that actually came in his way
disgracing his reputed father by a mean flight by sea and not showing
his true one as good evidence of the greatness of his birth by noble and
worthy actions as by the tokens that he brought with him
the shoes and the sword

with this mind and these thoughts he set forward with a design to do
injury to nobody but to repel and revenge himself of all those that
should offer any  and first of all in a set combat he slew
periphetes in the neighborhood of epidaurus who used a club for his
arms and from thence had the name of corynetes or the clubbearer who
seized upon him and forbade him to go forward in his journey  being
pleased with the club he took it and made it his weapon continuing to
use it as hercules did the lions skin on whose shoulders that served
to prove how huge a beast he had killed and to the same end theseus
carried about him this club overcome indeed by him
but now in his hands invincible

passing on further towards the isthmus of peloponnesus he slew sinnis
often surnamed the bender of pines after the same manner in which he
himself had destroyed many others before  and this he did without
having either practiced or ever learnt the art of bending these trees
to show that natural strength is above all art  this sinnis had a
daughter of remarkable beauty and stature called perigune who when
her father was killed fled and was sought after everywhere by theseus
and coming into a place overgrown with brushwood shrubs and asparagus
thorn there in a childlike innocent manner prayed and begged them
as if they understood her to give her shelter with vows that if she
escaped she would never cut them down nor burn them  but theseus
calling upon her and giving her his promise that he would use her with
respect and offer her no injury she came forth and in due time bore
him a son named melanippus but afterwards was married to deioneus the
son of eurytus the oechalian theseus himself giving her to him
ioxus the son of this melanippus who was born to theseus accompanied
ornytus in the colony that he carried with him into caria whence it is
a family usage amongst the people called ioxids both male and female
never to burn either shrubs or asparagusthorn
but to respect and honor them

the crommyonian sow which they called phaea was a savage and
formidable wild beast by no means an enemy to be despised  theseus
killed her going out of his way on purpose to meet and engage her so
that he might not seem to perform all his great exploits out of mere
necessity  being also of opinion that it was the part of a brave man to
chastise villainous and wicked men when attacked by them but to seek
out and overcome the more noble wild beasts  others relate that phaea
was a woman a robber full of cruelty and lust that lived in crommyon
and had the name of sow given her from the foulness of her life and
manners and afterwards was killed by theseus  he slew also sciron
upon the borders of megara casting him down from the rocks being as
most report a notorious robber of all passengers and as others add
accustomed out of insolence and wantonness to stretch forth his feet
to strangers commanding them to wash them and then while they did it
with a kick to send them down the rock into the sea  the writers of
megara however in contradiction to the received report and as
simonides expresses it fighting with all antiquity contend that
sciron was neither a robber nor doer of violence but a punisher of all
such and the relative and friend of good and just men for aeacus they
say was ever esteemed a man of the greatest sanctity of all the greeks
and cychreus the salaminian was honored at athens with divine worship
and the virtues of peleus and telamon were not unknown to any one  now
sciron was soninlaw to cychreus fatherinlaw to aeacus and
grandfather to peleus and telamon who were both of them sons of endeis
the daughter of sciron and chariclo it was not probable therefore
that the best of men should make these alliances with one who was worst
giving and receiving mutually what was of greatest value and most dear
to them  theseus by their account did not slay sciron in his first
journey to athens but afterwards when he took eleusis a city of the
megarians having circumvented diocles the governor  such are the
contradictions in this story  in eleusis he killed cercyon the
arcadian in a wrestling match  and going on a little farther in
erineus he slew damastes otherwise called procrustes forcing his body
to the size of his own bed as he himself was used to do with all
strangers this he did in imitation of hercules who always returned
upon his assailants the same sort of violence that they offered to him
sacrificed busiris killed antaeus in wrestling and cycnus in single
combat and termerus by breaking his skull in pieces whence they say
comes the proverb of a termerian mischief for it seems termerus
killed passengers that he met by running with his head against them
and so also theseus proceeded in the punishment of evil men who
underwent the same violence from him which they had inflicted upon
others justly suffering after the manner of their own injustice
