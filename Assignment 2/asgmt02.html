<p class="title">CS261 Assignment 2 Instructions</p>
<p class="header">Code To Start With</p>
<p>This assignment provides a you with a .zip file containing the code you should start with. The .zip file will expand into a folder that is set up to be both a BlueJ project and an Eclipse project.</p>
<p><span class="header">JAR Files</span> </p>
<p>Java executables are packaged as JAR (<strong>J</strong>ava <strong>AR</strong>chive) files. A JAR file is actually a Zip file. You can open a JAR file with any Zip utility (e.g. <a href="http://7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>). Once you&rsquo;re ready to submit your work, you will need to create a JAR file containing your code. Both BlueJ and Eclipse have the ability to do this (see the <strong>How To Create a JAR File...</strong> sections below). In order for your work to be graded, your JAR file must be executable from the command line.</p>
<p>Each JAR file contains a folder named <strong>META-INF</strong>. This folder contains a file named <strong>MANIFEST.MF</strong>, which is the JAR file&rsquo;s &ldquo;manifest file.&rdquo; The manifest file is a text file that specifies which Java class in the JAR file contains the<span class="code"> main()</span> method. The Java Virtual Machine needs this information in order to be able to run your code from the command line.</p>
<p> You should not change the structure of your project folder <em>in any way</em>. Do not rename files, do not move files to a different folder, do not create new folders or files, etc. I grade your code using a Python script that depends on files and folders being in the expected places.</p>

<h3 class="header">Regular Assignment</h3>
<p><i>There is no Premium version for this assignment</i> <br />
  <br />
  Starting with the provided code, write a Java command-line application that shuffles a standard deck of playing cards,
and then deals the cards in the normal manner. You should look at the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html" target="_blank"><u>card-related code</u></a> from this Java web page. Your code should use the <strong>enum</strong> feature of Java that is mentioned on that page.</p>
<p>The provided code contains five class definitions:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
  <li>Assignment2.java</li>
  <li>Dealer.java</li>
  <li>Deck.java</li>
  <li>Hand.java</li>
  <li>Card.java</li>
</ul>
</td>
    <td align="left" valign="top" width="20">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="left" valign="top">
      <p><em>contains the </em><span class="code">main()</span><em> method</em><br />
        <em>deals out the hands of cards</em><br />
      <em>the deck of playing cards</em><br />
      <em>a set of cards dealt by the dealer</em><br />
      <em>a playing card</em></p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When you write your code, you should have each of these classes do what would be appropriate in a real-world card game. The Deck, for instance, should not deal itself into Hands &#8211; the Dealer should do that. A Hand of cards should compute its own score &#8211; the Dealer <em>should not</em> do that. In other words, your code should exhibit good <em>cohesion</em>. Your code will be graded, in part, on its cohesion with respect to the concept of a card game.</p>
<p>Do not add any additional classes to this project. Do not delete any of the classes that are provided.</p>
<p> Five things will be specified on the command line: </p>
<ul>
  <li>number of games</li>
  <li>number of hands dealt</li>
  <li>number of cards per hand</li>
  <li>number of cards per line in the printout</li>
  <li>whether to shuffle the deck before dealing<br />
  (i.e. whether to re-order the cards in a random manner)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code should work with various values of these command line arguments.<br />
  <br />
  Each card has a score, computed as the product of its values in the following tables:
</p>
<table cellspacing="30">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><table border="1" cellpadding="8" bgcolor="EEEEEE" class="tableCellBg">
      <tr>
        <td><i>Suit</i></td>
        <td align="center"><i>Value</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Heart</td>
        <td align="center">4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Diamond</td>
        <td align="center">3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Club</td>
        <td align="center">2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Spade</td>
        <td align="center">1</td>
      </tr>
    </table></td>
    <td width="20"></td>
    <td><table border="1" cellpadding="8" bgcolor="EEEEEE" class="tableCellBg">
      <tr>
        <td><i>Card</i></td>
        <td align="center"><i>Value</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ace</td>
        <td align="center">11</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>King, Queen, Jack</td>
        <td align="center">10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10 &ndash; 2</td>
        <td align="center">the number on<br />
          the card</td>
      </tr>
    </table></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The ACE of SPADES, for example, has a score of 11.  The FOUR of HEARTS has a score of 16.</p>
<p>You should implement these scores by having each member of the <i>Suit</i> and <i>Card</i> enums
carry its own score. <i>If you do not do this, you will lose significant points in your grade.</i></p>
<p>A hand's score is computed as the sum of the scores of the cards it contains.</p>
<p>Your application, when run from the command line like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">java -jar asgmt02.jar 2 5 5 3 false</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Should produce output identical to the contents of <strong>asgmt02.out.txt</strong>, which is contained in <strong>asgmt02.zip</strong>.</p>

<p>In this example, the code was told not to shuffle the deck. When your code does not shuffle the deck, <em><u>it is required</u></em> that your cards be in the same order as what&rsquo;s shown in <strong>asgmt02.out.txt</strong><em>.</em> In other words, when the deck is not shuffled, <span class="text">ACE of HEARTS</span> should be the first card, <span class="text">KING of HEARTS</span> should be the second, and so on down to <span class="text">DEUCE of SPADES</span> being the last card.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Important:</span> note  that the first card in the deck goes into the first hand, the second card in the deck
  goes into the second hand, and so on &ndash; just like how you would actually deal
  playing cards in the physical world. <br />
  <br />
Make sure that your deck prints the specified number of cards per line for as many lines as needed to print the 52 cards in the deck. Note that when a group of cards is printed out, a comma follows each card except the last one, <em>including at the ends of lines</em>. Your code will need to do this.</p>
<p>Start your work with the <strong>asgmt02</strong> project, which is both a BlueJ project and an Eclipse project. Submit your work as <b>asgmt02.jar</b>.  Make sure to include your <span class="style1">.java </span>source code files in your <span class="style1">.jar </span>file. <br />
</p>
<p class="header">Grading</p>
<p>Your work will be graded on the quality of your object-oriented design
  in addition to how well it works. In particular, pay attention to <em>cohesion</em>. The classes in your code should do what the entities that make up an actual game of cards would do. A class should not do anything that its corresponding real-world entity would not do.</p>
<p>For example, a Card class <em>would not</em> manage collections of cards; a Deck class would not deal itself. Instances of a Card class should represent individual playing cards, and its code should only do things that relate to the capabilities and attributes of an individual card. Do not allow the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html" target="_blank"><u>card-related code</u></a> to influence your decisions about your object-oriented design. While this code can be useful to you as a starting point, don&rsquo;t assume that it&rsquo;s well-written just because it appears on an &ldquo;official&rdquo; web page. </p>
<p class="header">Required JAR File Structure</p>
<p>Here is the required structure for the .jar file that you will submit for either version of this assignment:</p>
